# EstiIoT
The future of Retail, Commerce, and POS.

## About.
EstiIoT is a new ecosystem for buying and selling. Stores can now have a modern, sleek, and elegant system for their customers. EstiIoT is a ecosystem of POS Systems, Kiosks, Cashier Machines, and more, all interconencted through the EstiIoT cloud network. The EstiIoT cloud connects all "nodes" in a store together, as well as stores together. The cloud is also use in conjunction with the EstiIoT App, allowing users to buy, order, and pay to any EstiIoT enabled store, right thorough their smartphone.

## Software
EstiIoT is powered by a Node.js and Java front-end, and a Node.js backened. The front end ("nodes") use Windows Embedded Standard, which will run on the Cashiers, Kiosks, Tablets, etc. All nodes communicate via the EstiIoT Cloud, meaning centrilized, secure, communication.

## Hardware
Most, if not all, of the the nodes for EstiIoT will run a x86 architecture, as we are using Windows. Nodes will also feature a custom chasis, deisgned to be sleek, yet durable. Touchscreens will also be standard.

## Development Status.
EstiIoT is currently under heavy development, and is not ready for consumer use.

Software Status: In Development

Hardware Status: Not yet in development.

##Legal
Use of EstiIoT on non-EstiIoT Authorized Hardware or Software is prohibited. Do not attempt to tamper with to software to bypass security mesures to circumvent any part of the software.
